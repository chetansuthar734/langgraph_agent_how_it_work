Introduction to Langgraph

LangGraph is an orchestration framework designed to manage complex multi-agent interactions using a graph-based structure. It provides a structured way to define workflows that integrate LLM agents, functions, tools, shared variables (graph state), and memory into a unified system. Unlike traditional sequential execution frameworks, LangGraph allows developers to control both the flow of execution and the state of the system, making it well-suited for applications that require dynamic interactions between multiple components.


With LangGraph, you can:

    [1].Define workflows: 
                      that determine how different functions and LLM calls interact.
    
    [2].Create agents :
                      LLMs equipped with tools that can execute actions based on incoming data.
    
    [3].Manage system state:
                        Enabling components to share and modify variables across the execution flow.
    
    [4].Control execution flow: 
                          Allowing for flexible branching, looping, and conditional decision-making within AI-driven processes.
    
    [5].Implement human-in-the-loop interactions:
                                       Enabling users to intervene, provide feedback, or adjust decisions within automated workflows.
